                Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting
                moving images and sound. The term can refer to a television set,
                or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass
                medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.

                Television became available in crude experimental forms in the
                late 1920s, but only after several years of further development
                was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War
                II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting
                became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and
                television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and
                institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary
                medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color
                broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed
                countries.

                The availability of various types of archival storage media such
                as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk
                drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and
                Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled
                viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on
                their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the
                convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and
                video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the
                video-on-demand service by Netflix). At the end of the first
                decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly
                increased in popularity. Another development was the move from
                standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced
                lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television
                (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially
                higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p,
                1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart
                television, Internet television has increased the availability
                of television programs and movies via the Internet through
                streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video,
                iPlayer and Hulu.

                In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set.
                The replacement of earlier cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen
                displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative
                technologies such as LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED),
                OLED displays, and plasma displays was a hardware revolution
                that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most
                television sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs.
                Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT,
                Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma, and even
                fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. In the near future,
                LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs. Also, major
                manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce
                smart TVs in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet
                and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by
                the late 2010s.

                Television signals were initially distributed only as
                terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency
                television transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual
                television receivers. Alternatively television signals are
                distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems
                and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s,
                these were transmitted as analog signals, but a transition to
                digital television was expected to be completed worldwide by the
                late 2010s. A standard television set consists of multiple
                internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving
                and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device that
                lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a
                television.

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p>
                  The word television comes from Ancient Greek τῆλε (tele)
                  'far', and Latin visio 'sight'. The first documented usage of
                  the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist
                  Constantin Perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in
                  French at the first International Congress of Electricity,
                  which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International
                  World Fair in Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The anglicised version of the term is first attested in 1907,
                  when it was still "...a theoretical system to transmit moving
                  images over telegraph or telephone wires".It was "...formed in
                  English or borrowed from French télévision." In the 19th
                  century and early 20th century, other "...proposals for the
                  name of a then-hypothetical technology for sending pictures
                  over distance were telephote (1880) and televista (1904)."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The abbreviation TV is from 1948. The use of the term to mean
                  "a television set" dates from 1941. The use of the term to
                  mean "television as a medium" dates from 1927. The term telly
                  is more common in the UK. The slang term "the tube" or the
                  "boob tube" derives from the bulky cathode-ray tube used on
                  most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs. Another slang
                  term for the TV is "idiot box".

                    The earliest systems employed a spinning disk to create and
                    reproduce images. These usually had a low resolution and
                    screen size and never became popular with the public.

                  <h3>CRT</h3>
                  <p>
                    The cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one
                    or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron
                    emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images. It
                    has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s)
                    onto the screen to create the images. The images may
                    represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures
                    (television, computer monitor), radar targets or others. The
                    CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep
                    (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly
                    heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the
                    face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be
                    highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions,
                    particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product. In
                    television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area
                    of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a
                    fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by
                    controlling the intensity of each of the three electron
                    beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and
                    blue) with a video signal as a reference. In all modern CRT
                    monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic
                    deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and
                    driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube,
                    although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in
                    oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument.

                  <h3>DLP</h3>
                  <p>
                    Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of video projector
                    technology that uses a digital micromirror device. Some DLPs
                    have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It
                    was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of
                    Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented
                    by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was
                    introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital
                    Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy
                    Awards in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector
                    technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications
                    from traditional static displays to interactive displays and
                    also non-traditional embedded applications including
                    medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is
                    used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units
                    for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private
                    homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a
                    projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear projection
                    television sets and digital signs. It is also used in about
                    85% of digital cinema projection.

                  <h3>OLED</h3>
                  <p>
                    An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting
                    diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer
                    is a film of organic compound which emits light in response
                    to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor
                    is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one
                    of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create
                    digital displays in devices such as television screens. It
                    is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as
                    mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. There are
                    two main groups of OLED: those based on small molecules and
                    those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED
                    creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which
                    has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays
                    can use either passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix
                    (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a
                    thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual
                    pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger
                    display sizes. An OLED display works without a backlight.
                    Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner
                    and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD). In low
                    ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen
                    can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the
                    LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight.
                    OLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near
                    future.

              <p>
                A smart TV, also known as a connected TV (CTV), is a traditional
                television set with integrated Internet and interactive Web 2.0
                features, which allows users to stream music and videos, browse
                the internet, and view photos. Smart TVs are a technological
                convergence of computers, televisions, and digital media
                players. Besides the traditional functions of television sets
                provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices
                can provide access to over-the-top media services such as
                streaming television and internet radio, along with home
                networking access.
              </p>
              <p>
                Smart TV should not be confused with Internet TV, IPTV, or
                streaming television. Internet TV refers to receiving television
                content over the Internet instead of traditional systems such as
                terrestrial, cable, and satellite, regardless of how the
                Internet is delivered. IPTV is one of the Internet television
                technology standards for use by television broadcasters.
                Streaming television is a term used for programs created by many
                producers for showing on Internet TV.
              </p>
              <p>
                In smart TVs, the operating system is preloaded into the
                television set's firmware, which provides access to apps and
                other digital content. In contrast, traditional televisions
                primarily act as displays and are limited to vendor-specific
                customization. The software applications can be preloaded into
                the device or updated or installed on demand via an application
                store or marketplace, in a similar manner to how applications
                are integrated into modern smartphones
              </p>
              <p>
                The technology that enables smart TVs is also incorporated in
                external devices such as set-top boxes and some Blu-ray players,
                game consoles, digital media players, hotel television systems,
                smartphones, and other network-connected interactive devices
                that utilize television-type display outputs. These devices
                allow viewers to find and play videos, movies, TV shows, photos,
                and other content from the Web, cable or satellite TV channels,
                or a local storage device.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                  In the early 1980s, "intelligent" television receivers were
                  introduced in Japan. The addition of an LSI chip with memory
                  and a character generator to a television receiver enabled
                  Japanese viewers to receive a mix of programming and
                  information transmitted over spare lines of the broadcast
                  television signal. A patent was filed in 1994 (and extended
                  the following year) for an "intelligent" television system,
                  linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or
                  analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one
                  key point is its ability to automatically download necessary
                  software routines, according to a user's demand, and process
                  their needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, descriptions of the elements of a smart television
                  can be found in public discourse from the beginning of the
                  1980s, if not earlier, with the introduction of videotex
                  services, particularly teletext information for reception by
                  television sets, leading commentators to consider that
                  televisions and accessories would evolve to encompass a range
                  of related activities. In the words of one commentator: "In
                  the long run, this machine is likely to develop into a
                  multi-purpose receiver, for electronic mail, dealing with the
                  bank, calculations, remote information - and 'Not the nine
                  o'clock news' or 'Casablanca' on video."

                  The mass acceptance of digital television in the mid-late
                  2000s and early 2010s greatly improved Smart TVs. Major TV
                  manufacturers have announced production of Smart TVs only for
                  their middle-end to high-end TVs in 2015. Smart TVs became the
                  dominant form of television during the late 2010s. At the
                  beginning of 2016, Nielsen reported that 29 percent of those
                  with incomes over $75,000 a year had a Smart TV.

                          Kodi/XBMC is royalty-free and cross-platform. The core

                          under GNU GPL v2. It offers the possibility for easy
                          rebranding by an original design manufacturer (ODM) or
                          original equipment manufacturer (OEM), with
                          customizing of interface look and feel using skins,

                          available via Python scripts for content extensions.
                          Due to these reasons, many systems integrators have
                          created modified versions of Kodi, along with a JeOS
